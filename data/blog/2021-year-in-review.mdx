2021 was arguably my best year to date, both professionally and personally.
Since there was a global pandemic, I didn't expect all that much this year, however it has been fantastic.

## Highlights

- 👰‍♀️🤵‍♂️ Got married
- 🏡 Lived in Poland & Portugal
- 📈 Grew TimeNavi to 150,000 users
- 🇵🇱 Finished A1 level Polish
- 🧑‍💻 Started freelancing for tech companies

## Personal

Hands down, my biggest life event this year was getting married to Hania.
I am so fortunate to be blessed with an amazing marriage and it has been a fantastic first 6 months of living together.
The wedding wasn't able to be attended by everyone in my close family, but it was still great to celebrate with everyone that could make it.

Since being married, Hania and I have decided to move to new places every 3 months to explore the advantages and disadvantages of living in different countries. we started this year with Poland and Portugal, and will spend the first half of next year in Croatia, Cyprus and Madeira. We've experienced how easy it is to travel in this decade with AirBnB and many other useful online services that provide information about the safety and living standards of every city in the world (If you're planning on doing this yourself, you'll find nomadlist.com a very helpful resource).

Lastly, an unexpected win this year has been learning polish. My polish teacher, Ania, has been instrumental in encouraging me to develop my Polish throughout the year and together we finished A1 Polish, which is harder than it sounds.

## Professional

During the course of this year I have devoted a lot of time to TimeNavi, the company that me and Hania set up together last year. We have both learned a huge amount from running TimeNavi, talking with our customers and helping them improve their time management. TimeNavi is growing faster than we expected, reaching 150,000 users by the end of this year and I'm looking forward to what the next year has to come.

Alongside working on TimeNavi, I have been learning a lot of new tools this year to improve my product development skills. Amongst them are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

These tools represent the best of what I could find for building a great startup MVP. You won't go wrong using a tech stack like this.
